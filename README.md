# journal_app

A simple journal app with cloud Firebase integration.

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates a working Flutter application with two Firebase integrations: authentication (via username and password) and realtime database. This app is part of a curriculum that teaches students the basic of Dart and the Flutter framework.

The app lets a user write quick notes, view past notes and delete entries one by one.

The app also offers an option to sync user's journal entries as a single JSON file to a remote Firebase store. Otherwise, if the user does not want to, they can continue using the app offline with no impact from the remote sync function.
